## About this project

This blog is part of the 100 Days of Code course by Angela Yu on Udemy.
I made it to practice building REST APIs using Flask and other tools.
I focused more on backend and security with Werkzeug than on design and CSS.

Note: The contact page is not active by default.
You can set it up using this form service: [Start Bootstrap Contact Forms](https://startbootstrap.com/solution/contact-forms)
